Welcome to Your Career in Cloud Computing – Expert Viewpoints.
In this video, we will listen to several cloud application professionals discuss career opportunities
in cloud computing for example, cloud developer, architect, SRE or networking specialist.
First of all, the cloud native landscape is very diverse.
It's very intimidating.
So, when you see the cloud native computing foundation map of different layers and different
solutions in each layer, it can get quite scary very fast.
So, my first advice to anybody entering cloud computing field would be to really get a solid
foundation and understanding of the basics.
How is developing for cloud different than developing something on your laptop or on
a single server or a small cluster?
So, think about how you would architect your application differently for the cloud computing
world?
How would you split it up into smaller services that talk to each other instead of creating
a big monolith?
And why does that matter??
If you want a job in a cloud related profession, I would realize for the first part that almost
all the tools that the actual professionals use are available.
Many are open source, and many have free versions just out there on the internet.
So, I think the most important thing is just go and get your hands dirty.
Use the tools that the professionals use, start learning there's so much free education
out there, and so many resources in the internet, quite frankly, to get you almost all the way
there.
But reading only got so far.
So, use the tools, run the code, create the code, do whatever you need to do.
And honestly, if you start creating projects, that's going to be one of the most attractive
things to a recruiter, in my personal opinion.
I think it's really important to never stop learning and to always apply what you learn
to projects, whether they're at home at work or at school.
My second advice to beginners will be to try different cloud platforms and see
how an application is approached or architected in these different platforms.
You can learn a lot by looking at different architectures.
To start a career in cloud related professions start learning on your own from different
sources, you can start by learning basic cloud concepts.
Learn about the various career opportunities that cloud computing has to offer.
Once you know which profession interests you the most enroll in a specialized course for
the same.
Get hands-on knowledge by creating some projects on your own and hosting them on your GitHub
repository.
Once you are confident of your skills, it is always a good idea to get certified.
Keep yourself informed about the different opportunities in companies and keep applying.
The advice I would give to someone who’s thinking about a career as a cloud architect,
is, if you don’t have any years of experience, just get a certification to start out with
or
get a feel, you’ll instantly become validated in front of recruiters.
And even if you don’t have the battle experience of making mistakes yourself in production,
you will be able to understand the high level of the services and then get into the readers
when the time comes.
One thing you got to be comfortable with cloud development is learning all the time.
Because all the services are changing all the time.
And you can’t be an expert at anything, really, because it’s changing all the time.
So be comfortable with all the ambiguity.
Here are a couple of suggestions for you.
One is to get certified from one or more of the cloud providers, IBM, AWS, Microsoft,
or Google Cloud.
And to do that,
I would recommend taking advantage of cost-effective online courses like those offered by Coursera
to ensure that you gain the knowledge and need to both pass the certification exam and
to you know, perform the job that you’re after and succeed in your cloud journey.
And then I would recommend augmenting your certification with some hands-on experience
either obtained on the job or by taking advantage of guided projects on Coursera or even experimenting
with your own hands-on projects.
In the case of Coursera guided projects, they're designed to provide you with hands-on experience
with some skill and approximately two hours.
And try things out in the cloud.
So just get your hands dirty, and spin up a virtual machine in the cloud, spin up.
function, write a function, make him go to a two, which goes to another function, just
try hooking things up together in the cloud.
And one more thing about the career advice, once you get your cloud certification, put
that on LinkedIn, because recruiters search for cloud certifications.
And that’s pretty much a guaranteed interview for you.
In my final advice would be always ready to scale up.
This landscape in this cloud native world changes really fast.
And you have to be on your toes and always learning new things and new technologies and
frameworks.
