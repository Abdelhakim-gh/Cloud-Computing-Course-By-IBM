In this video, we will look at
some case studies that demonstrate the use of
cloud computing in real business scenarios and
the ensuing impact on
these businesses and the customers they serve.
The weather company's mission is to
map the atmosphere of the Earth and based on that,
generate the most accurate and hyperlocal forecast
of which can be solved out to
all our consumers and devices,
which number in millions across the globe.
Weather is unpredictable and we need to be
able to spin up and spin down as fast as weather happens.
Our normal day-to-day load is 30 million unique users.
When we peek into severe weather that can go
north of 100 million across our products.
We generate forecasts on-demand.
Our forecasts on-demand system
is responsible for generating
forecast at a resolution of one squared kilometer grid.
We deliver forecasts on-demand
to the tune of 250 billion per day.
On the backside of that is our API platform.
That system operates at the scale of about
150,000 requests per second.
If our products don't work and don't work fast,
people's lives are in danger.
Imagine a hurricane is
approaching East Coast of the United States.
As it is approaching the coast,
usage of my weather data,
goes up tremendously.
It can go up from anywhere from two times to five times.
It took us six months to migrate into to
IBM Kubernetes from our previous provider.
What we've noticed is some real efficiencies with DevOps.
It's reduced our workflow in pipeline
by about 80%.
With the latest hurricane,
we were able to scale with IBM Cloud
very easily, very seamlessly.
IBM's community service,
allows us to scale as fast as the weather happens.
As we migrated our VEP platform
to IBM Cloud Kubernetes Services,
one of the biggest advantages
is that this is a managed service--
which allows our team
not to have to babysit our system,
enables them to do other work.
With the migration to IBM Cloud Kubernetes,
we've gained the ability to
have automation security baked in.
This was a feature and a component that was
very manual for us in the past.
IBM's security team proactively
now notifies us of any security vulnerabilities.
The tools and the investment that the company has
made gives us capabilities
that we would have never had before.
It gets us very excited and it gives our developers and
engineers opportunities to build
new things that they wouldn't have
otherwise been able to do.
The global reach that IBM and IBM
Cloud together with our technology,
with our capabilities for forecasting,
give us the ability to extend our products and
services to keep people safe all over the world.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome aboard, captain speaking.
Pretty much anticipating on-time arrival.
In a scenario where there's a flight cancellation
or some other off-schedule operation,
we've had a system where we find
new seats and flights availability for those customers.
But I think oftentimes customers didn't
necessarily know that that was the best option for them.
What we wanted to do was create a system
where they could actually see alternate options.
The goal was to facilitate
a better experience for our customers on how to
get to their destination in
an automated fashion on the channel of their choice.
In our business, hurricanes, storms,
other natural events impact
our customers on a fairly regular basis.
What happened and this is a true story.
The hurricanes hit and everybody said "this is ridiculous,"
our customers were being impacted
by the hurricanes immediately.
Why are we mitigating risk of
a traditional rollout when
we have the power of the cloud?
This is exactly the scenario that
our customers need this capability.
I think people now realize that
these activities and integration are
much easier when we can use
cloud technology and especially microservices,
we can break problems into much smaller problems.
Those get much easier to
wrap your head around and develop.
This is the technology that we need to be adopting now
in order to keep pace with our customer expectations.
What I love about my job at Cementos Pacasmayo is
that it challenges me every single day.
Technology moves so agile that I have to keep up with it.
What I love it that the company is also on
that same road driving
towards its digital transformations.
Our customers are now demanding quicker time to
market and also a more broad portfolio of
products we need to keep up and deliver
the best service and the best products that they
can get in the least amount of time.
We implemented SAP S/4HANA on IBM Cloud,
since it brings us a cost-effective Infrastructure,
and also it's quite scalable.
Cementos Pacasmayo is now turning from
a product-driven company to a service driven company.
The accounting area now has real insights on
real-time of our financial statements
that they didn't use to have.
Also on our supply and chain area,
especially on the procurement,
they now have the dashboard that
helps them take decisions right on time.
My name is Mukesh Sharma
and I'm the Senior Manager of IT at Welch Food.
Welch's started as organization
150 years ago and pretty fast
it became the national hallmark. We're owned by the farmers;
it's a co-up, and we value
the sweat equity our farmers put into it.
That's what drives us every day
that our farmers are working out on the farms,
and we're working here to
make sure the organization gives
the best benefit of each dollar spent back to them.
Welch's IT is the heart of the business.
All the manufacturing systems,
any manufacturing data which
comes in through different processing,
ERP systems and you name it.
We started this journey with the private cloud.
Then at the same time,
we have started the process of asking
ourselves on any new application request.
Can it be run in the public cloud?
The approach we have taken is slowly and
steadily start to move
these non mission-critical systems,
which can be done better by somebody else.
Let them run outside,
let them spend time on it while
we spend time on our core values.
Liquid Power is a company
that sells products that when you
inject them into crude oil or gasoline pipelines,
it changes the flow characteristics to
such a point that you can either one,
increase the flow of those fluids, or secondly,
use less energy to
actually push the fluids down the pipeline.
We needed to become
a standalone company under Berkshire Hathaway.
Without any experience in running
our own infrastructure for SAP,
we had to come up with the solution that was best for
our business to operate as a standalone company.
There were many decisions we had to make.
Do we go cloud? Do we stay on-premise?
How do we create our own infrastructure and
back-office and what's the best decision for us,
not only today and now,
but in the future going forward.
I talked to some CIOs and IT professionals.
If you had a blank sheet of paper, what would you do?
Cloud or go on-premise?
Without a doubt, all of them say cloud.
This whole process and the migration to
the cloud is giving what we
believe is a competitive advantage.
What I really love about having
IBM with SAP on the cloud is it's scalable.
We can do it much faster and change
in a much faster time period than we could otherwise.
