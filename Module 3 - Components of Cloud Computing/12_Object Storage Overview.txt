In this video, we're going to start to
understand what object storage is,
how data is stored in object storage,
and how it differs from
the more traditional storage types,
such as file and block storage.
The first thing to note about
object storage is that you do not
connect it to a particular compute node
in order to use it.
Instead, you provision
an object storage service instance and
use an API or
application programming interface to upload,
download, and manage your data.
This means you can directly use
object storage with anything that you
can call an API and you
don't need an underlying compute node.
The second thing to note about
object storage is that it's
less expensive than other Cloud storage options.
It's per gigabyte cost is
typically a couple of US cents per month,
and in some cases,
even less depending on the storage tier used,
more on storage tiers later.
The third and possibly most important thing to note about
object storage is that it's effectively infinite.
With file and block storage,
you specify the size of the storage you
want in gigabytes or terabytes,
and then pay a fee based on the size you provisioned.
With object storage you just consume the storage you
need and pay per gigabyte cost for what you use.
You can keep uploading files
and the storage will never run out.
When would you use object storage?
Well, object storage is great for
storing large amounts of unstructured data.
By unstructured, this means that the data is not stored
in any kind of hierarchical folder
or directory structure.
Object storage uses buckets,
and objects are stored within
these buckets in a structurally flat way.
A bucket is a bit like a folder,
in the sense that you can give
them meaningful names and,
of course, have different buckets
for different object types.
But you cannot place a bucket with in a bucket.
When an object is placed in a bucket,
it also has some metadata.
Data about the data added to it,
such as an object ID.
This metadata helps applications to
both locate and access the object,
as well as provide information on the time
that the data was stored or last accessed.
When you create a bucket,
you don't need to provide or
define any sizing information.
The bucket will just hold
the data that you place inside it.
And the service provider ensures that there
is sufficient storage capacity available.
Buckets can hold as little as a few bytes of data,
right up to multiple petabytes and you can build up
the amount of data stored as
slowly or quickly as you'd like,
as well as shrink it back down again.
The service provider also
takes care of resilience and making
sure that the object storage solution
is highly available.
Some Cloud providers offer different types of
buckets within different levels of resilience.
For example, they offer buckets which are resilient,
but the data is only stored in one data center.
This is a good option where data needs to reside in
a particular geographical location or in
situations where high availability is less of an issue.
They will then offer buckets which are
highly available across regions
where the data is stored multiple times in
different data centers or zones in the same region,
or even in multiple regions.
These options usually cost more,
but they provide both the highest level of
resilience as well as availability for your data.
Object storage has a very flat storage structure,
which we'll explain in the next lesson.
This data can be anything from
text files to audio files and video files from
IoT data to virtual machine images
from backup files to data archives.
Pretty much any data which is static and where
fast read and write speeds are not necessary,
would make a good fit for objects storage.
Object storage would, however,
not be suitable for running operating systems,
nor applications such as databases or
anything else where the contents of the files changes.
To summarize what we have learned in this lesson,
object storage is used to store
files or objects which are static.
The data that you can store using object storage can be
anything from text files to audio and video files,
from IoT data to virtual machine images,
from backup files to data archives.
You cannot run operating systems or
other applications such as
databases using objects storage.
Objects are stored in buckets.
You can have multiple buckets but you
cannot place buckets within buckets.
You do not need to specify a size for a bucket.
You can just use as little or as much space as you need.
Many providers offer different types of
buckets with different charges for each.
Some are based on resilience and availability,
while others are based on the frequency at
which the objects inside are accessed.
In the next video,
we'll be diving into
object storage data tiers and object storage APIs.
